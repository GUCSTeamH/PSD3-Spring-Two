PSD3-Spring-Two
===============

Task for PSD3 Sprint Week Two


Compiling and Running
---------------------
First make sure that Maven is in your PATH. (usually add the \bin folder)
To compile cd into the git repo and run <code>mvn clean package</code>

To run the server run the command <code>java -jar target/psd3-tech-proto-0.1.0.jar</code>

Once the server is running, visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

*I am not sure if the .project file for eclipse works correctly, but it is added there incase it screws up the repo like it did for the last sprint week*
